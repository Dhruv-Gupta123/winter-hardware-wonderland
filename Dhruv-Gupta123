project: The all in one robo

I an going to build a robot car that will have the following features-
1. can be controlled by mobile using bluetooth
2. can be controlled by a wireless remote
3. can avoid any obstacle in between
4. can follow your hand
5. can move away from your hand
6. can be controlled using a wearable glove by moving your hand

The following featues in the car can be switched form one to another by the remote, bluetooth, glove, a board present in the car
## PlAN

first i will 3d design the sturcture of the car and the 3d print it after that i will attach the motors on the 3d printed parts after that i will connect
the motors to the motor driver and the motor driver to arduino after that i will connect the sensors to the arduino then i will use a glove to connect the adxl335
(accelerometer), rf module, arduino, etc and code for making the car gesture controlled and the 3d print a remote and connect the joystick module, arduino, rf module,
switches,etc and code it.
